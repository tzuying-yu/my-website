This is the notes of what I learned about the blogdown today.

# The process of building a blogdown website
1. Go to File > New project > New directory > Website using blogdown > Create website. For this step, it generates a new directory that contains serveal files and folders. The general directory structure is:
* content/ 
  - about.md
  - post/ (where you put all your rmarkdown post here)
* static/ 
  - Question: what is it used for?
* themes/ 
  - the theme is pre-selected in the first step (Question: how to change the theme if already created the website?)
  - Go to https://themes.gohugo.io/ for more theme templates
* public/ 
  - For my experience, it don't generate automatically after use the blogdown::serve_site(). So go to the top left panel > Build > Build Website. Then, it will generate the public/ folder for you.
  - Question: what is it used for?
* R/
  - Question: what is it used for?
* resources/
  - Question: what is it used for?
* config.yaml: Hugo and theme configuration file.
* .Rprofile: File to set up your blogdown options.
* netlify.toml: File to set up your Netlify options.

# How to preview the site locally 
1. Use the Addins > Serve site.
2. Console > blogdown::serve_site().
Serving the site did the following:
- Started a local Hugo server to help you preview your website, and
- Knitted .Rmd post to an .html page. 

# When doubt, run blogdown::check_site() in console
You will see what files were checked, which checks were successful, and blogdown will offer [TODO] items when a check needs your attention

# configure site: the config.yaml
The config.yaml file stores your website configurations for Hugo and for your Hugo theme. You will usually only edit this file during the initial site setup.

# Addins
1. Serve site
- where you can preview site (mentioned above)
2. New post
- After filling the basic info about the new post, it will automatically generate a new folder under post/
3. Update metadata
- Metadata is the ymal in rmarkdown, the category and tags.
- This addin allows you to update the YAML metadata of the currently opened post.
4. Insert images
- This addin allows you to insert any image in your computer to your currently opened post. The following the example.

# Global options
The global options are stored in the .Rprofile in the root directory.
1. blogdown.hugo.version
- A Hugo version number -> (Default) A valid Hugo version	
- A common mistake when specifying this option is to omit the version number 0 at the end. For example, only Hugo v0.55.0 exists, but not v0.55, so options(blogdown.hugo.version = '0.55') will not work, and you must set it to 0.55.0 precisely.
2. blogdown.knit.on_save
- Knit Rmd files automatically on save? -> (Default) TRUE
3. blogdown.method	
- The output format of .Rmd posts -> (Default)

4. blogdown.serve_site.startup
- Serve the site on RStudio startup? -> (Default) FALSE
